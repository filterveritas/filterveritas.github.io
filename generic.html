							<p>Every citizen is an activist, initiator of social, political, technological, economic change. Each one of us has the responsibility to conduct their own intellect, common sense, skill set, knowledge, attitude and creative potential towards creating opportunities for themselves and for the others. Each one of us has the right to be inspired from the diversity and plurality of the cultures, traditions, philosophies, theories, practices, perceptions. Each one of us has the obligation to challenge the paradigms of the [current] reality and share their ideals, visions, inventions.

Movements, networks, changes, turnovers, quests… new truths, justified and legitimate.</p>
